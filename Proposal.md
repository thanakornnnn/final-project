## what is this project for
Here's a concise overview of the administrative steps for undertaking a senior projectâ€”a process each of you will experience in the future. Initially, a leading student conceives an engaging project and recruits up to two members to establish a group. The group then secures an advisor to oversee the project, and upon agreement, submits a proposal to the advisor. Following approval, the group proceeds to complete the project and subsequently submits the project report to the advisor for approval.
